# dataset-of-TSPDSTS

This dataset comprises sets of small-scale instances used in the related paper, containing space-time-state network data for 35 instances under four time-dependent patterns.

The instances are named as aN_bC_cS, where "a" denotes the total number of space nodes, "b" represents the number of customers, and "c" signifies the number of stations, with a = b + c. The network includes at least two stations: the origin and destination depots. 

We hope this dataset will serve as a valuable reference for researchers in the field and contribute, in a modest way, to advancing related studies.
